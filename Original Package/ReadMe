Flexible ROM Corruptor
Written in C++ and LUA
Designed for Windows and Linux

  This program was written to provide Linux with a ROM corruptor and fix common
issues with the corruption community, such as having to run the Vinesauce ROM
corruptor as a standalone corruptor while running Real-Time Corruptor as a
real time corruptor, by providing the functionality found in both corruptors.

2) Installation
